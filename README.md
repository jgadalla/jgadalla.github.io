## Welcome to Justin Gadalla's GitHub Page

I am currently in the process of learning this website and all of the nuances to creating a page, but for now here is a raw variant of my page (obviously not a final draft).

My ultimate goal in creating this page is to have a hub where all of my projects can be viewed by potential employers and allow them to be updated with exactly what I am working on as well as what I have worked on in the past.
